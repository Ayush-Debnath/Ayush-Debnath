# 👋 Hey there! I'm Ayush Debnath

I'm a Computer Science Engineering undergrad passionate about turning complex ideas into real, working tech.  
Currently diving deep into **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and everything in between.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Into
- 🤖 **AI & ML Projects** – I build stuff that learns, adapts, and sometimes surprises me.
- 🎮 **Game Development + AI** – Like *Red Plane AI*, a Flappy Bird-style game where NEAT algorithm trains planes to fly better than humans.
- 🎨 **Generative Art** – Using Conditional GANs to create unique artwork based on emotions.
- 🧱 **Systems Programming** – Working on a custom compiler and operating system from scratch using LLVM and Rust.
- 💡 **Problem Solving** – I love making things efficient, clean, and scalable.

## 🚀 Current Projects
- 🛩️ **Red Plane AI** – An AI-powered side-scrolling game using NEAT and Pygame.
- 🎭 **Emotion2Art** – Generate art based on how you feel using CGAN and AffectNet.
- 🧵 **Custom Compiler/OS** – Learning how computers *really* work by building from the ground up.
